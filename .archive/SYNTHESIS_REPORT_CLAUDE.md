# LIMINAL Documentation Synthesis Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of three AI-generated documentation suites (Claude, Codex, Gemini) for the LIMINAL project, evaluating each against five key criteria and the foundational research archive. The goal is to synthesize these into a single, superior canonical documentation suite.

**Key Finding:** The documentation suites show complementary strengths - Gemini excels in vision and technical depth, Claude provides practical implementation guidance, and Codex offers focused developer workflows. The canonical version will leverage these respective strengths.

3. **Agent Capabilities**: Use Claude (best decision trees and visual aids)
4. **Message Priority**: Use Gemini (outstanding multi-domain research)
5. **Integration Tests**: Use Claude (most comprehensive test coverage)

### Key Integration Points
- Merge Claude's practical implementation guidance throughout
- Incorporate Gemini's research depth and technical sophistication
- Maintain Claude's excellent visual aids and decision trees
- Ensure consistent terminology and cross-references

### Quality Targets for Canonical Version
- **Technical Accuracy**: Match Gemini's sophisticated implementations
- **Practical Guidance**: Match Claude's implementation clarity
- **Research Integration**: Match Gemini's deep synthesis
- **Visual Aids**: Match Claude's decision trees and diagrams
- **Completeness**: Exceed all three versions through selective merging

### Implementation Notes
1. Start with the selected base document for each file
2. Carefully integrate complementary sections from other versions
3. Ensure consistent tone and technical depth throughout
4. Validate all code examples and technical specifications
5. Cross-reference between documents for consistency
6. Add any missing elements identified in the gap analysis

## Conclusion

The three documentation suites demonstrate complementary strengths that, when synthesized, will produce a superior canonical documentation. Gemini provides the strongest technical foundation and research integration, Claude offers the best practical implementation guidance and visual aids, while Codex contributes focused developer workflows. The synthesis plan outlined above will create documentation that exceeds any individual version in both technical depth and practical utility.

**Next Step:** Upon approval of this synthesis plan, proceed to create the `docs-canonical/` directory with the synthesized documentation suite.
