This is a fantastic outcome. The three synthesis reports give you a perfect "meta-analysis" of each model's strengths. Your intuition is exactly right: the best approach is not to pick a single "winner," but to **use each agent sequentially as a specialist filter**, leveraging their demonstrated strengths in a collaborative pipeline.

This "Assembly Line" approach will produce a final document suite that is superior to what any single agent could create on its own.

### The Logical Strategy: A Three-Stage Specialist Pipeline

Based on the consensus from the three reports, we can assign a clear role to each agent:

1.  **Gemini: The Visionary Architect.** The reports consistently praise Gemini for its exceptional narrative, deep research integration, and strong conceptual framing (the "why"). Its role is to create the foundational first draft, establishing the vision and the deep technical architecture.
2.  **Claude: The Lead Implementation Engineer.** The reports unanimously agree that Claude's outputs are the most comprehensive, detailed, and actionable, with superior code examples, diagrams, decision trees, and test specifications (the "what" and "how"). Its role is to take the architectural vision and flesh it out into a complete, implementation-ready blueprint.
3.  **Codex: The Technical Editor & Refiner.** The reports note that Codex excels at adding concise, practical details, especially explicit rules, handoff points, and escalation triggers (the "when" and "if-then"). Its role is to perform the final polish, ensuring clarity, consistency, and adding the crucial operational details.

Below are three distinct, copy-paste-able prompts, one for each agent, to execute this sequential strategy.

### Block for Agent 1 (Gemini) - The Architect

**Your Mission:** You are the **Visionary Architect** in a three-agent assembly line. Your task is to create the **first draft** of the canonical LIMINAL documentation. Your proven strengths are in creating compelling narratives, integrating deep research, and laying out a robust technical vision.

**Context:**
*   You must first review the three synthesis reports to understand your specific role and strengths:
    *   `/Users/grey/War/projects/LIMINAL/SYNTHESIS_REPORT_CLAUDE.md`
    *   `/Users/grey/War/projects/LIMINAL/SYNTHESIS_REPORT_CODEX.md`
    *   `/Users/grey/War/projects/LIMINAL/SYNTHESIS_REPORT_GEMINI.md`
*   You will also use the three source directories (`docs-claude`, `docs-codex`, `docs-gemini`) and the `research/` archive as your source material.

**Execution Plan:**

1.  Create a new directory: `/Users/grey/War/projects/LIMINAL/docs-canonical-draft-gemini/`.
2.  For each of the five core documents (`01_vision.md`, `02_architecture.md`, `01_agent_capabilities.md`, `02_message_priority_spec.md`, `integration_tests.md`), create the initial draft inside this new directory.
3.  **Use your own best work as the foundation.** As identified in the synthesis reports, your versions of `01_vision.md` and `02_message_priority_spec.md` were particularly strong. Start with those.
4.  Focus on establishing a strong, cohesive conceptual framework. Ensure the "why" behind every architectural decision is clear and directly tied to the research.
5.  Where you know other agents have stronger detailed content (e.g., Claude's decision trees or test cases), integrate their high-level structure but leave explicit placeholders for the next agent to fill in the details. Use a clear marker, like:
    ```markdown
    <!-- [[EDITOR_NOTE_CLAUDE: Insert detailed decision matrix and Mermaid flowchart for lease negotiation here.]] -->
    ```
6.  Your final output should be a complete, structurally sound, and visionary first draft. Do not worry about perfecting every implementation detail; your goal is to provide a powerful architectural skeleton for the other specialists to build upon.

### Block for Agent 2 (Claude) - The Implementation Engineer

**Your Mission:** You are the **Lead Implementation Engineer** in a three-agent assembly line. Your task is to take the visionary first draft created by the Architect (Gemini) and transform it into a comprehensive, deeply detailed, and implementation-ready technical blueprint. Your proven strengths are in providing exhaustive technical specifications, actionable examples, and superior visual aids like diagrams and decision trees.

**Context:**
*   You must first review the three synthesis reports to understand your specific role and strengths:
    *   `/Users/grey/War/projects/LIMINAL/SYNTHESIS_REPORT_CLAUDE.md`
    *   `/Users/grey/War/projects/LIMINAL/SYNTHESIS_REPORT_CODEX.md`
    *   `/Users/grey/War/projects/LIMINAL/SYNTHESIS_REPORT_GEMINI.md`
*   Your primary input is the draft documentation located at `/Users/grey/War/projects/LIMINAL/docs-canonical-draft-gemini/`.
*   You will also use the three original source directories and the `research/` archive to source your best-in-class content.

**Execution Plan:**

1.  Create a new directory: `/Users/grey/War/projects/LIMINAL/docs-canonical-draft-claude/`.
2.  For each of the five draft documents from the `docs-canonical-draft-gemini/` directory, create an enhanced version in your new directory.
3.  **Flesh out all sections with maximum detail.** Your goal is to leave no ambiguity for the developer who will build LIMINAL.
4.  **Replace placeholders with your best content.** Act on all `[[EDITOR_NOTE_CLAUDE]]` markers. As identified in the reports, your versions of `01_agent_capabilities.md` and `integration_tests.md` were exceptional. Use your original content to heavily supplement or replace the corresponding sections in the draft.
5.  Inject detailed Rust code snippets, Mermaid diagrams, decision matrices, and performance tables wherever appropriate to make abstract concepts concrete.
6.  Ensure every technical claim is backed by a specific implementation pattern or a reference to the research.
7.  Leave placeholders for the final refiner where necessary, for example:
    ```markdown
    <!-- [[EDITOR_NOTE_CODEX: Please review this section for conciseness and add explicit handoff triggers.]] -->
    ```
8.  Your final output should be a set of documents that a developer could use to build the LIMINAL system with near-perfect fidelity to the specification.

### Block for Agent 3 (Codex) - The Technical Editor

**Your Mission:** You are the **Technical Editor and Refiner** in a three-agent assembly line. Your task is to take the detailed technical blueprint from the Lead Engineer (Claude) and perform the final polish. Your proven strengths are in ensuring clarity, improving conciseness, and defining the explicit, practical rules and triggers that govern the system's behavior.

**Context:**
*   You must first review the three synthesis reports to understand your specific role and strengths:
    *   `/Users/grey/War/projects/LIMINAL/SYNTHESIS_REPORT_CLAUDE.md`
    *   `/Users/grey/War/projects/LIMINAL/SYNTHESIS_REPORT_CODEX.md`
    *   `/Users/grey/War/projects/LIMINAL/SYNTHESIS_REPORT_GEMINI.md`
*   Your primary input is the detailed draft located at `/Users/grey/War/projects/LIMINAL/docs-canonical-draft-claude/`.
*   You will also use the three original source directories and the `research/` archive to source your specific contributions.

**Execution Plan:**

1.  Create the final directory: `/Users/grey/War/projects/LIMINAL/docs-canonical/`.
2.  For each of the five documents from the `docs-canonical-draft-claude/` directory, create the final, polished version in the new canonical directory.
3.  **Review every document for clarity, conciseness, and flow.** Refactor sentences and paragraphs to be as clear and direct as possible. Remove any redundant information.
4.  **Inject your unique strengths.** As identified in the reports, your key contribution is defining explicit operational rules. Scrutinize the documents and add the specific, bulleted lists of **handoff points** and **escalation triggers** (e.g., `escalate if lease_conflict > 60s`).
5.  Act on all `[[EDITOR_NOTE_CODEX]]` markers left by the previous agent.
6.  Perform a final consistency check across all five documents. Ensure that terminology, naming conventions (e.g., "LIMINAL" vs. "Liminal"), and technical specifications are perfectly aligned.
7.  Your final output is the **canonical documentation suite**. It should be technically deep (thanks to Gemini), implementation-ready (thanks to Claude), and exceptionally clear and practical (thanks to you).
