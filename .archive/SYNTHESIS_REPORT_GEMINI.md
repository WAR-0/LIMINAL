### Analysis of: `conceptual/01_vision.md`

**Comparison Table:**

| Criteria | `docs-claude` | `docs-codex` | `docs-gemini` |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Clarity and Cohesion | Excellent | Very Good | Excellent |
| 2. Technical Depth and Accuracy | Excellent | Good | Very Good |
| 3. Completeness and Mandate Adherence | Excellent | Good | Very Good |
| 4. Integration of Source Research | Very Good | Good | Very Good |
| 5. Structural Integrity | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent |

**Strengths & Weaknesses:**

*   **Claude Version:**
    *   **Strengths:** Most comprehensive vision, with a clear definition of AI Director and Human Director roles, including specific handoff points and configurable escalation triggers. Includes a strong "Technical Manifesto".
    *   **Weaknesses:** None noted.
*   **Codex Version:**
    *   **Strengths:** Clear and concise. The "Roles and Handoffs" section at the end is a good summary.
    *   **Weaknesses:** The integrated description of the Director roles is less detailed than in the other versions.
*   **Gemini Version:**
    *   **Strengths:** Excellent, clearly written "Delineation of Roles" section that is very easy to understand.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Slightly less detail on the specific technical triggers for escalation compared to Claude's version.

**Synthesis Recommendation:**

Use the **Claude** version as the base. Merge in the following sections:
- The "Delineation of Roles: The Human-AI Partnership" section from the **Gemini** version to replace the equivalent section in the Claude document, as it is the clearest explanation of the two roles.
- Ensure the final version explicitly includes the handoff points and escalation triggers detailed in both the Claude and Codex versions.

### Analysis of: `conceptual/02_architecture.md`

**Comparison Table:**

| Criteria | `docs-claude` | `docs-codex` | `docs-gemini` |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Clarity and Cohesion | Excellent | Good | Excellent |
| 2. Technical Depth and Accuracy | Excellent | Good | Excellent |
| 3. Completeness and Mandate Adherence | Excellent | Incomplete | Excellent |
| 4. Integration of Source Research | Excellent | Good | Excellent |
| 5. Structural Integrity | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent |

**Strengths & Weaknesses:**

*   **Claude Version:**
    *   **Strengths:** Extremely detailed and comprehensive. Includes high-quality Rust code snippets, performance targets, and the most detailed architecture diagrams. The lease negotiation algorithm is fully specified.
    *   **Weaknesses:** None noted.
*   **Codex Version:**
    *   **Strengths:** Provides a good high-level overview. Introduces the interesting concept of a "Physics-Based Coordination Engine".
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lacks the deep technical specifics of the other versions, particularly around the Context Snapshot and Territory Manager. The diagrams are less informative. Some sections feel incomplete.
*   **Gemini Version:**
    *   **Strengths:** Outstanding explanation of the "Context Snapshot Implementation", directly referencing the research documents and specifying the `serde` + `Bincode` stack. The "Lease Negotiation Algorithm" and "Director and Human Roles" sections are also exceptionally clear.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Diagrams are less detailed than Claude's.

**Synthesis Recommendation:**

Use the **Claude** version as the base for its completeness, diagrams, and detailed code. Merge in the following sections:
- The entire "Context Snapshot Implementation" section from the **Gemini** version. It is the best-written and most technically specific version.
- The "Lease Negotiation Algorithm" description from the **Gemini** version to complement the code in the Claude version.
- The "Director and Human Roles" section from the **Gemini** version for its clarity.

### Analysis of: `reference/01_agent_capabilities.md`

**Comparison Table:**

| Criteria | `docs-claude` | `docs-codex` | `docs-gemini` |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Clarity and Cohesion | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent |
| 2. Technical Depth and Accuracy | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent |
| 3. Completeness and Mandate Adherence | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent |
| 4. Integration of Source Research | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent |
| 5. Structural Integrity | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent |

**Strengths & Weaknesses:**

*   **Claude Version:**
    *   **Strengths:** Extremely comprehensive and actionable guide for agent developers. The combination of flowcharts, decision matrices, and code examples is highly effective. Includes sections on Director-specific capabilities and metrics.
    *   **Weaknesses:** None noted.
*   **Codex Version:**
    *   **Strengths:** Identical to the Claude version in almost every respect.
    *   **Weaknesses:** No significant differences.
*   **Gemini Version:**
    *   **Strengths:** Identical to the Claude version in almost every respect.
    *   **Weaknesses:** No significant differences.

**Synthesis Recommendation:**

Use the **Claude** version as the base. The three versions are nearly identical, but the Claude version is formatted slightly better and feels marginally more complete. No merging is required.

### Analysis of: `reference/02_message_priority_spec.md`

**Comparison Table:**

| Criteria | `docs-claude` | `docs-codex` | `docs-gemini` |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Clarity and Cohesion | Excellent | Very Good | Very Good |
| 2. Technical Depth and Accuracy | Excellent | Good | Good |
| 3. Completeness and Mandate Adherence | Excellent | Good | Good |
| 4. Integration of Source Research | Excellent | Very Good | Very Good |
| 5. Structural Integrity | Excellent | Good | Good |

**Strengths & Weaknesses:**

*   **Claude Version:**
    *   **Strengths:** A true technical specification. It provides Rust code examples, defines a 4+1 priority system, and details mechanisms for preventing priority inflation and inversion. It is the most actionable and complete document.
    *   **Weaknesses:** None noted.
*   **Codex Version:**
    *   **Strengths:** Provides excellent background and rationale by drawing lessons from various domains (OS scheduling, QoS, etc.). It's a strong "why" document.
    *   **Weaknesses:** It reads more like a design proposal than a final specification. It lacks the implementation details of the Claude version.
*   **Gemini Version:**
    *   **Strengths:** Similar to the Codex version, it provides great context and reasoning behind the design choices.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lacks implementation details.

**Synthesis Recommendation:**

Use the **Claude** version as the base, as it is a proper technical specification.
- **Merge:** Incorporate the "Lessons from..." sections from the **Codex** version into the introduction of the Claude document. This will provide valuable context and justification for the technical decisions outlined in the spec.

**Strengths & Weaknesses:**

*   **Claude Version:**
    *   **Strengths:** By far the most superior version. It is a comprehensive, actionable test specification with detailed, code-level test cases, performance benchmarks, and success criteria. It even includes definitions for test utilities.
    *   **Weaknesses:** None noted.
*   **Codex Version:**
    *   **Strengths:** Outlines a reasonable set of high-level test scenarios.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lacks any implementation detail, code examples, or specific metrics. It is a high-level plan, not a test spec.
*   **Gemini Version:**
    *   **Strengths:** Similar to Codex, it identifies the correct areas to test.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Also lacks implementation detail and reads like a preliminary outline.

**Synthesis Recommendation:**

Use the **Claude** version as the base. It is vastly superior to the others. No merging is required.
