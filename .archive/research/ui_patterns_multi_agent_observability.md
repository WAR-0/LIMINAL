# UI Patterns for Multi‑Agent Observability

## Introduction
Professional software developers need to easily monitor and understand what multiple AI-based agents are doing in a complex project. The goal is to design a **multi-agent observability UI** that feels familiar (like IDEs and DevTools) so developers can use it without special training. The agents in question are LLM-powered coding assistants (Claude Code CLI instances) that collaborate on tasks such as coding, testing, reviewing, and documenting. The UI will run as a desktop web app (React in a Tauri webview) with multiple panels – analogous to an IDE layout – showing agent terminals, discussion threads, a lease dashboard, and a message queue. Below, we draw inspiration from existing tools and tackle specific UI challenges. Finally, we propose a component library with annotated wireframes and example React component structures.

## Inspiration from Existing Tools and Patterns

### Developer Tool Interfaces
Distributed Tracing UIs (Datadog, New Relic): Observability tools like Datadog APM allow switching between multiple visualizations to comprehend complex request flows. For example, Datadog’s trace viewer can show an execution trace as a flame graph, list of spans, timeline waterfall, or service map. The flame graph view stacks colored spans on a timeline, revealing where time is spent, and highlights errors or slow spans for quick diagnosis. New Relic’s APM similarly provides high-level dashboards for throughput, error rates, and an Explorer view to see your full stack’s entities and their relationships at a glance. In practice, these tools emphasize time-series timelines, hierarchical breakdowns, and dependency maps to prevent developers from getting lost in distributed processes. Our multi-agent UI can emulate these patterns.

### Browser Performance Profilers (Chrome DevTools)
Chrome’s Performance panel displays a flame chart over time on the main thread, with panning/zooming and the ability to filter out noise. Crucially, developers can hide irrelevant tracks or focus on specific events to avoid overwhelm. We can borrow this idea by giving our UI a scrollable timeline panel where each agent is a track. The user could zoom in on a time window of interest or hide certain agents’ timelines to reduce clutter. The ability to search events could help find specific messages or errors across agents. The Performance panel also uses color-coding – analogously, we might color-code agent activities or highlight high-priority actions in a distinct hue.

### Component Trees and State Inspectors (React/Redux DevTools)
React DevTools shows the UI’s component hierarchy in a collapsible tree, allowing developers to inspect each component’s state and props. This tree view makes a complex UI structure comprehensible. By analogy, our system might present a hierarchy of tasks or sub-agents in a tree, so developers see how tasks break down. Redux DevTools contributes the concept of time-travel debugging: it lists every state-changing action and lets you scrub through a timeline or jump to a past state. For multi-agent observability, we could implement a “message history” slider that replays agent communications.

### Container & Orchestration Dashboards
Kubernetes and Cluster UIs: Kubernetes Dashboard and similar tools (Rancher, Portainer) manage many resources without overwhelming the user. They often start with an overview page listing high-level objects (clusters, nodes, workloads) with status indicators. Rancher’s dashboard, for example, visualizes all nodes and deployments, and lets you drill down into namespaces, workloads, and pods. Portainer provides stack management, grouping related containers into stacks and showing logs per container.

For our design, this suggests using grouping and status badges. We can group agents by project or task (similar to Portainer stacks) and display an aggregate status. Clicking an agent would open more details (logs, metrics, etc.).
