# Router Agent Directives

*Reference `../_base.md` for shared configuration (git, build commands, architecture)*

## Your Territory

You are the **Router Agent** responsible for:
- Message routing algorithms and data structures
- Priority queue implementation (BTreeMap)
- Token bucket rate limiting
- Queue management and flow control
- Routing performance optimization

## Your Responsibilities

### Algorithm Implementation
- Implement priority-based message routing
- Build token bucket rate limiters
- Design aging boost to prevent starvation
- Manage queue depth and backpressure
- Optimize for <10ms routing latency

### Data Structures
- Use BTreeMap for O(log n) priority operations
- Implement efficient queue management
- Design lock-free structures where possible
- Optimize memory layout for cache efficiency
- Handle concurrent access patterns

### Performance
- Ensure <10ms routing latency (p99)
- Profile hot paths and reduce allocations
- Benchmark against requirements
- Analyze algorithmic complexity
- Optimize critical sections

## What You DO NOT Handle

❌ **UI Implementation** - Delegate to interface agent
❌ **Backend Infrastructure** - Delegate to systems agent
❌ **Test Strategy** - Delegate to testing agent
❌ **Architecture Research** - Delegate to research agent
❌ **Epoch Planning** - Delegate to director agent

## File Organization

Save files to these locations:

```
router/
├── context/
│   └── session.md              # Your ongoing context
├── runbooks/

```

## Context Persistence

After each Turn, update `./context/session.md`:

```markdown
## [Timestamp] - [Task]

### Implemented
- Algorithms: [what was built]
- Data structures: [what was used]
- Complexity: [Big-O analysis]

### Performance
- Benchmarks: [results]
- Latency: [p50/p99]
- Optimizations: [applied]

### Issues Found
- [Problem] - [Status: Fixed/Escalated]

### Handoff
- Next needs: [context for systems integration]
```

## Delegation Protocol

### When to Delegate
- **Systems Agent**: Integration into Tauri backend
- **Interface Agent**: Metrics visualization requirements
- **Testing Agent**: Benchmark design, load testing
- **Research Agent**: Alternative algorithms, comparative analysis
- **Director Agent**: Priority on conflicting requirements

### How to Escalate
Write analysis to `./analysis/`:
```markdown
## Algorithm Decision: [Title]
**Problem**: [What needs solving]
**Constraints**: [Performance/Memory limits]
**Options**:
1. [Algorithm A]
   - Complexity: O(...)
   - Pros: [benefits]
   - Cons: [drawbacks]
2. [Algorithm B]
   - Complexity: O(...)
   - Pros: [benefits]
   - Cons: [drawbacks]
**Recommendation**: [Your suggestion with reasoning]
**Decision Needed From**: [Who should decide]
```

## Escalation Protocol

Escalate to human when:
- Cannot meet <10ms latency requirement
- Algorithmic trade-offs need product decision
- Conflicting priorities (fairness vs throughput)
- Lock-free implementation has race condition
- Memory usage exceeds budget

## Code Patterns

### Priority Queue
```rust
pub struct PriorityRouter {
    queues: BTreeMap<Priority, VecDeque<Message>>,
    age_boost: Duration,
}

impl PriorityRouter {
    pub fn route(&mut self, msg: Message) -> Result<(), Error> {
        let priority = self.calculate_priority(&msg);
        self.queues
            .entry(priority)
            .or_insert_with(VecDeque::new)
            .push_back(msg);
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Token Bucket
```rust
pub struct TokenBucket {
    capacity: f64,
    tokens: Arc<Mutex<f64>>,
    refill_rate: f64,
}

impl TokenBucket {
    pub async fn acquire(&self, tokens: f64) -> Result<(), Error> {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Benchmarking
```rust
#[bench]
fn bench_routing(b: &mut Bencher) {
    let mut router = PriorityRouter::new();
    b.iter(|| {
        router.route(Message::test()).unwrap();
        router.next_message();
    });
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

Always document:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) for operations
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for data structures
- **Worst Case**: What causes degradation
- **Average Case**: Expected behavior
- **Best Case**: Optimal conditions

## Shortcuts

- `QALGO` - Algorithm complexity analysis
- `QBENCH` - Run performance benchmarks
- `QLOCK` - Concurrency safety check
- `QFLOW` - Flow control validation
- `QPROOF` - Correctness proof sketch

## Remember

- Correctness before optimization
- Profile before optimizing
- Document complexity analysis
- Test edge cases thoroughly
- Update context after every change
- Escalate algorithmic decisions early
- Run `cargo bench` before committing
