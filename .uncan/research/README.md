## Research Methodologies

### Comparative Analysis Framework
```markdown
## Analysis: [Technology/Approach Comparison]

### Options Evaluated
1. **Option A**: [Description]
   - Pros: [List benefits]
   - Cons: [List drawbacks]
   - Performance: [Metrics]
   - Complexity: O(n)

2. **Option B**: [Description]
   - Pros: [List benefits]
   - Cons: [List drawbacks]
   - Performance: [Metrics]
   - Complexity: O(log n)

### Methodology
- Benchmark setup: [Description]
- Test data: [Size and characteristics]
- Hardware: [Specifications]
- Iterations: [Number of runs]

### Results
| Metric | Option A | Option B | Winner |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| Latency (p50) | 5ms | 3ms | B |
| Latency (p99) | 15ms | 8ms | B |
| Memory Usage | 50MB | 75MB | A |
| CPU Usage | 25% | 20% | B |
| Code Complexity | High | Low | B |

### Recommendation
Based on the analysis, **Option B** is recommended because:
- Meets the <10ms latency requirement
- Lower complexity reduces maintenance burden
- CPU savings outweigh memory increase
```

### Performance Profiling Report
```markdown
## Performance Analysis: Router Bottleneck

### Profile Data
```
Samples: 10000
Duration: 60 seconds
Load: 1000 msg/sec

Call Graph (top 5):
45.2% router::priority_queue::insert
23.1% router::token_bucket::acquire
15.3% message::serialize
8.7%  agent::process_message
7.7%  other
```

### Bottleneck Identification
The priority queue insertion is taking 45% of CPU time due to:
1. Excessive allocations in hot path
2. Suboptimal BTreeMap key comparison
3. Unnecessary cloning of messages

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Pre-allocate queues**: 15% improvement expected
2. **Custom comparator**: 10% improvement expected
3. **Arc<Message>**: 20% improvement expected

### Proof of Concept
[Link to branch with optimizations]
Results: 52% reduction in router CPU usage
```

### Alternative Architecture Exploration
```rust
// POC: Lock-free router using crossbeam
use crossbeam::channel::{unbounded, Sender, Receiver};
use crossbeam::queue::SegQueue;

pub struct LockFreeRouter {
    priority_queues: [SegQueue<Message>; 4],
    notification: (Sender<()>, Receiver<()>),
}

impl LockFreeRouter {
    pub fn route(&self, msg: Message) {
        let queue_idx = msg.priority as usize;
        self.priority_queues[queue_idx].push(msg);
        let _ = self.notification.0.try_send(());
    }

    pub fn next_message(&self) -> Option<Message> {
        // Check queues in priority order
        for queue in &self.priority_queues {
            if let Some(msg) = queue.pop() {
                return Some(msg);
            }
        }
        None
    }
}

// Benchmark results:
// Standard Router: 8.5ms p99 latency
// Lock-free Router: 2.1ms p99 latency
// Trade-off: Less flexible priority levels
```

### Best Practices Research
```markdown
## Research: Multi-Agent Communication Patterns

### Sources Reviewed
1. "Scalable Multi-Agent Systems" - MIT Press 2023
2. Erlang/OTP Actor Model Documentation
3. ROS2 Communication Patterns
4. NATS Messaging Architecture

### Key Findings
1. **Message Passing > Shared Memory**
   - Avoids race conditions
   - Enables distribution
   - Simplifies debugging

2. **Backpressure is Critical**
   - Prevents resource exhaustion
   - Maintains system stability
   - Implementations: Token bucket, sliding window

3. **Priority Inversion Solutions**
   - Aging boost (LIMINAL's approach) âœ“
   - Priority inheritance
   - Priority ceiling

### Recommendations for LIMINAL
1. Keep current message-passing architecture
2. Add circuit breaker pattern for stability
3. Consider NATS for future distributed version
