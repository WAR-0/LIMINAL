## 2. Architectural and Code-Level Optimizations

### 2.1 Concurrency Control for 90% Cost Reduction

#### Problem: Uncontrolled Async Request Scheduling
**Source**: Towards Data Science, August 21, 2025

#### Root Cause Analysis:
- **Task Scheduling Issue**: Creating all tasks at once with `as_completed()` immediately schedules all coroutines
- **No Concurrency Control**: All 100 requests start simultaneously, regardless of early stopping conditions
- **Resource Waste**: Unnecessary API calls continue even after reaching stopping criteria
- **Rate Limiting**: Causes provider rate limit issues and system overload

#### Solution: Semaphore-Based Concurrency Control
```python
import asyncio
from aiohttp import ClientSession
from tqdm.asyncio import tqdm_asyncio

async def fetch(session: ClientSession, url: str, semaphore: asyncio.Semaphore) -> str:
    async with semaphore:  # Lightweight lock controls concurrency
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            body = await response.json()
            return body["value"]

async def main():
    results = []
    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(int(STOP_AFTER * 1.5))  # Control concurrent requests
    
    async with ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [fetch(session, URL, semaphore) for _ in range(NUMBER_OF_REQUESTS)]
        
        for future in tqdm_asyncio.as_completed(tasks, total=NUMBER_OF_REQUESTS, desc="Fetching"):
            response = await future
            if response:
                results.append(response)
                if len(results) >= STOP_AFTER:
                    break  # Early termination prevents unnecessary requests
```

#### Results Achieved:
