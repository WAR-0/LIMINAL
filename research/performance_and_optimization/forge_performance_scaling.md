# Performance and Scalability Strategy for FORGE

**Objective:** To ensure the FORGE system can scale from a single-developer setup to enterprise-level teams, we adopt proven scalability patterns and performance optimizations. This document outlines key architectural strategies (actor model, microservices, CQRS/event-sourcing, sharding, load balancing), critical performance techniques in Rust (async patterns, zero-copy, memory pooling, lock-free structures, `io_uring`), multi-tenancy considerations, and a scaling plan with benchmarks. The focus for v1 is a single-machine deployment (targeting ~10 concurrent agents), with a roadmap to 50 agents on one machine (v2) and eventually 100+ distributed agents across clusters.
