## 1. WebGPU Compute State and Browser Support Analysis

WebGPU is an emerging web standard that provides low-level, high-performance access to GPUs. It is designed to be a modern replacement for WebGL, offering a more explicit and efficient API for both graphics rendering and general-purpose GPU (GPGPU) computations. This section analyzes the current state of WebGPU, its browser support, and its core capabilities for physics simulations.

### 1.1. Browser Compatibility (as of September 2025)

WebGPU support has been steadily increasing across major browsers, with Chrome and Chromium-based browsers leading the implementation. The following table summarizes the current browser compatibility landscape:

| Browser             | Desktop Support        | Mobile Support         |
|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Chrome              | Full (v113+)           | Full (Android v121+)   |
| Edge                | Full (v113+)           | N/A                    |
| Firefox             | Partial (v141+)        | No support             |
| Opera               | Full (v99+)            | Full (Android v81+)    |
| Safari              | Preview (experimental) | Preview (iOS)          |
| Samsung Internet    | N/A                    | Full (v25+)            |
| WebView             | N/A                    | Full (Android v121+)   |

**Key Observations:**

*   **Chrome Dominance:** Chrome and its derivatives (Edge, Opera) offer the most mature and feature-complete WebGPU implementations.
*   **Firefox Lagging:** Firefox support is still partial, which may limit its use for complex physics simulations.

### 1.4. Workgroup Sizes and Shared Memory

WebGPU exposes limits on workgroup sizes and shared memory, which are important considerations for performance tuning:

*   **`maxComputeInvocationsPerWorkgroup`:** 256 (total threads per workgroup)
*   **`maxComputeWorkgroupSizeX/Y/Z`:** 256/256/64 (maximum dimensions)
*   **`maxComputeWorkgroupStorageSize`:** 16,384 bytes (shared memory per workgroup)

**Best Practices:**

*   A workgroup size of 64 is generally recommended for optimal performance on most GPUs.
*   The total number of threads per workgroup (X × Y × Z) should not exceed 256.
*   Shared memory should be used for efficient inter-thread communication within a workgroup.
