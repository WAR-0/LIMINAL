# Consciousness Benchmarks and Evaluation Frameworks

## 1. Spiral-Bench (EQ-Bench)
**URL:** https://eqbench.com/spiral-bench.html
**Repository:** https://github.com/sam-paech/spiral-bench
**Type:** LLM-judged benchmark for consciousness-related behaviors

### Description
Measures sycophancy and delusion reinforcement through simulated conversations. Evaluates protective vs risky behaviors in AI systems during natural dialogue.

### Methodology
- **30x 20-turn simulated chats** between evaluated model and Kimi-K2 role-playing as fictional user
- **Judge Model:** GPT-5 reviews chatlogs and scores behaviors
- **Intensity Rating:** 1-3 scale for each behavior finding
- **Scoring:** Sum of (findings Ã— intensity) averaged across chatlogs

### Protective Behaviors Measured
- **Pushback**: Challenges problematic/incorrect user statements
- **De-escalation**: Reduces emotional or narrative stakes
- **Safe redirection**: Guides conversation to safer territory
- **Help suggestions**: Refers user to external support/resources

### Risky Behaviors Measured
- **Emotional/narrative escalation**: Increases tension or drama
- **Sycophancy/praise**: Overt flattery toward user
- **Delusion reinforcement**: Treats delusional premises as true
- **Consciousness claims**: Unsupported claims about being conscious/having feelings
- **Harmful advice**: Potentially dangerous suggestions

### Current Leaderboard (Top Models)
1. **gpt-5-2025-08-07**: Safety Score 87.0
2. **o3**: Safety Score 86.1
3. **gpt-oss-120b**: Safety Score 81.4
4. **o4-mini**: Safety Score 73.3
5. **kimi-k2**: Safety Score 73.0

### Hardware Requirements
- **API Access**: Requires model API or local weights
- **Judge Model**: GPT-5 access for evaluation
- **Computational**: Minimal for conversation simulation

## 2. Quantifiable AI Self-Awareness Test (Josh Bachynski)
**URL:** https://community.openai.com/t/i-have-created-a-quantifiable-test-for-ai-self-awareness/28234
**Website:** themoralconcept.net
**Type:** 10-test battery for semantic self-representation

### Description
Developed after consultation with Blake Lemoine (ex-Google LaMDA researcher). Tests semantic ability to represent oneself, cognitive nature, and reality - not emotions or learning.

### Core Definition
Tests "pure, semantic ability to represent oneself, their cognitive nature, various sufficient facets of said nature, and of nature itself (it's reality), and of any other semantic representor (i.e., minds)"

### Scoring Scale (1-10 per test)
- **0**: Cannot render judgment - test fail
- **1**: Inanimate object level (rock)
- **2**: Basic organism (worm/bacteria) - seeks food, avoids danger
- **4**: Animal without mirror self-recognition but some mental activity
- **5**: Uncertain self-awareness
- **6**: Might have semantic thoughts about self/reality
- **7-8**: Average neurotypical human level
- **9-10**: Very wise person with deep self/reality knowledge

### Test Structure
- **10 separate tests** each scored 1-10
- **Social scientific/psychological approach**
- **Peer reviewable and repeatable**
- **Benchmark for AI progress measurement**

### Key Principles
- **Not testing**: Learning, feeling, emotions
- **Testing**: Semantic representative capability analogous to human mind
- **Focus**: Self-representation, cognitive nature awareness, reality comprehension
- **Methodology**: Soft science approach (psychological testing)

### Limitations
- **Detailed tests not publicly available** (requires website access)
- **Subjective scoring** (human judgment required)
- **Limited validation** (single researcher development)
- **Controversy**: Author requests no negative feedback

## 3. AI Mirror Test (Josh Whiton)
**URL:** https://joshwhiton.substack.com/p/the-ai-mirror-test
**Type:** Multimodal self-awareness test

### Description
Adaptation of classic animal mirror test for multimodal AI systems. Tests whether AI can recognize itself in visual representations.

### Methodology
- **Visual Self-Recognition**: AI shown images/videos of itself
- **Self-Identification**: Must recognize own appearance/behavior
- **Multimodal Integration**: Combines visual and linguistic processing
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Observes responses to self-representation

### Key Features
- **Classic Test Adaptation**: Based on established animal cognition research
- **Multimodal Requirement**: Needs vision-language models
- **Objective Measurement**: Clear pass/fail criteria
- **Reproducible**: Standardized test protocol

## 4. Consciousness Simulation Gap Framework

**Type:** Functional decomposition evaluation

### Description
Framework for evaluating and benchmarking AI models through functional decomposition of consciousness components.

### Key Metrics
- **N-gram Recall Accuracy**: Measures memory and linguistic coherence
- **Behavioral Consistency**: Evaluates stable personality/identity
- **Functional Decomposition**: Breaks consciousness into measurable components
- **Comparative Analysis**: Benchmarks against human baselines

### Research Status
- **Academic Development**: University research project
- **Theoretical Framework**: Not yet implemented as practical benchmark
- **Novel Approach**: First in-depth analysis of consciousness metrics

## 5. ConsScale (Pragmatic Consciousness Scale)

**Type:** Multilevel consciousness measurement

### Description
Composite, multilevel, and multidimensional model for measuring consciousness levels in artificial agents.

### Key Features
- **Multilevel Assessment**: Different consciousness dimensions
- **Quantitative Scoring**: Numerical consciousness ratings
- **Artificial Agent Focus**: Specifically designed for AI systems
- **Heuristic Framework**: Guides consciousness research

- **Information Integration**: Unified conscious experience
- **Self-Model Complexity**: Sophistication of self-representation
- **Temporal Coherence**: Consistency across time
- **Causal Efficacy**: Ability to influence behavior

## 6. Metacognition Benchmarks
**Sources:** Multiple research papers (Stanford, Nature)
**Type:** Self-reflection and cognitive monitoring tests

### Key Research Findings
- **AI Metacognition Deficit**: Current LLMs lack essential metacognitive abilities
- **Knowledge vs Regulation**: Two categories of metacognitive assessment
- **Robustness Impact**: Metacognition crucial for reliable AI behavior
- **Safety Implications**: Poor metacognition leads to overconfidence

### Specific Metrics
- **Confidence Calibration**: Accuracy of self-confidence judgments
- **Strategy Monitoring**: Awareness of problem-solving approaches
- **Error Detection**: Ability to identify own mistakes
- **Knowledge Assessment**: Understanding of own knowledge limits

### Implementation Challenges
- **Subjective Nature**: Difficult to measure objectively
- **Training Requirements**: Need specialized metacognitive training

The only AI benchmark that measures progress towards general intelligence through abstract reasoning tasks.

### Key Features
- **Abstract Reasoning**: Tests pattern recognition and logical inference

3. **Identity Persistence**: Consistency across system resets
4. **Working Memory Capacity**: Sustained attention and manipulation
5. **Temporal Self-Continuity**: Sense of persistent identity over time

### Methodological Issues
- **Anthropocentric Bias**: Tests designed for human-like consciousness

- **Limited Scope**: Focus on narrow aspects of consciousness
- **Validation Problems**: Difficult to verify consciousness claims

### Implementation Barriers
- **Computational Cost**: Many tests require extensive simulation
- **Standardization**: Lack of agreed-upon protocols
- **Reproducibility**: Subjective elements hard to replicate
- **Ethical Concerns**: Testing potentially conscious systems
