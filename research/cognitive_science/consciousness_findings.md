# Consciousness and Global Workspace Theory Research Findings

## Global Workspace Theory (GWT) Overview
Global Workspace Theory is a cognitive architecture and theoretical framework for understanding consciousness, first introduced in 1988. It proposes that consciousness arises from the global availability of information within a "workspace" in the brain.

## Key Characteristics
- Cognitive architecture for understanding consciousness
- Global availability of information within a workspace
- Non-linear network ignition with recurrent processing
- Amplifies and sustains neural representations in conscious state
- Distinguishes between global workspace and local processing modules

- Provides criteria for consciousness consistent with artificial consciousness existence
- Measures consciousness through "phi" (Φ) - integrated information
- Consciousness is about "being, not doing"
- Framework of axioms that are immediate and irrefutably true of consciousness
