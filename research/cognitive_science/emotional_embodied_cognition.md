## Emotional Tagging & Somatic Markers Research Findings

**Source: Richter-Levin & Akirav, Brain Research Reviews, 2003**

### Emotional Tagging Hypothesis
- **Core Concept**: Amygdala activation during emotionally arousing events marks experiences as important
- **Memory Enhancement**: Emotional tagging aids in enhancing synaptic plasticity in other brain regions
- **Selective Processing**: Memory-related areas sort significant from less relevant aspects of experience
- **Long-term Storage**: Only emotionally tagged experiences are preferentially transformed into long-term memory

### Neural Mechanisms

#### Synaptic Tagging and Capture
- **Two-Factor Model**: Long-term plasticity requires (a) synapse-specific protein synthesis-independent tag and (b) synapse-non-specific protein synthesis activation
- **Tag-Dependent Plasticity**: Protein synthesis induces lasting plasticity only in synapses marked by tags
- **Amygdala Transformation**: Amygdala activation transforms transient into long-lasting plasticity
- **Threshold Reduction**: Amygdala triggers neuromodulatory systems that reduce synaptic tag activation threshold

#### Neuromodulatory Systems
- **Cross-Regional Effects**: Amygdala influences synaptic plasticity in hippocampus and other memory areas
- **Protein Synthesis Facilitation**: Emotional arousal facilitates transformation from early- to late-phase memory
- **Synapse Specificity**: Tags ensure only relevant synapses undergo long-term modifications
- **Temporal Coordination**: Emotional tagging coordinates timing of plasticity across brain regions

### Somatic Marker Hypothesis (Damasio)
- **Emotional Guidance**: Emotional processes guide and bias behavioral decisions
- **Physiological Responses**: Emotions create somatic (bodily) responses that influence future decision-making
- **Marker Signals**: Somatic markers influence response processes at multiple operational levels
- **Prefrontal Integration**: Prefrontal cortex integrates somatic signals with cognitive processing

### Computational Implications
- **Priority Encoding**: Emotional significance determines memory encoding priority
- **Resource Allocation**: Emotional tagging directs limited neural resources to important information
- **Adaptive Function**: System evolved to enhance survival-relevant memory formation
- **Cross-Modal Integration**: Emotional tags can influence multiple sensory and cognitive systems
- **Temporal Dynamics**: Emotional effects on memory occur across different time scales
- **Individual Variation**: Emotional tagging effectiveness varies across individuals and contexts


## Incubation & Insight Research Findings

**Source: Henok, Vallée-Tourangeau & Vallée-Tourangeau, Psychological Research, 2018**

### Incubation Theory
- **Definition**: Break period after initial unsuccessful problem-solving attempts that can lead to improved performance
- **Four-Stage Model**: Preparation → Incubation → Illumination → Verification (Wallas, 1926)
- **Restructuring Mechanism**: Incubation helps through mental representation reorganization during impasse
- **Unconscious Processing**: Some restructuring processes may occur unconsciously rather than through deliberate analysis

### Systemic Thinking Model (SysTM)
- **Distributed Cognition**: Information processing transformed when distributed across mental and material resources
- **Interactivity Effects**: High-interactivity environments substantially improve problem-solving performance
- **Material Engagement**: Physical manipulation of problem elements enhances cognitive processing
- **Context Dependency**: Problem-solving context after incubation is crucial for performance improvement

### Experimental Evidence

#### Cheap Necklace Problem (CNP) Studies
- **Low Success Rate**: Typically <10% solution rate in standard conditions
- **Incubation Benefits**: Significant performance improvement after 2-week gap, especially in high-interactivity conditions
- **Interactivity Advantage**: Physical chains vs. pen-and-paper dramatically improved performance
- **Context Switching**: Performance only improved when returning to highly interactive task environment

#### Meta-Analysis Findings (Sio & Ormerod, 2009)
- **Problem Types**: Significant incubation effects for creative, visual insight, and linguistic insight problems
- **Preparation Phase**: Longer initial struggle periods lead to stronger incubation effects
- **Moderator Variables**: Length of preparation phase is main moderator for visual insight problems

### Neural Mechanisms of Insight

#### Restructuring Processes
- **Strategy Switching**: Changing search strategies for possible moves
- **Constraint Relaxation**: Loosening assumptions about allowable problem moves
- **Chunk Decomposition**: Breaking down familiar feature patterns that block solution paths
- **Attention Withdrawal**: Removing focused attention allows unconscious processing

#### Aha! Moment Networks
- **Right Hemisphere Activation**: Increased activity in right temporal areas during insight
- **Default Mode Network**: Involvement in unconscious problem processing during incubation
- **Anterior Cingulate**: Monitors conflict and signals need for cognitive restructuring
- **Prefrontal Cortex**: Integrates restructured representations with working memory

### Computational Implications
- **Distributed Processing**: Cognition extends beyond individual brain to include environmental resources
- **Embodied Problem-Solving**: Physical interaction with problem elements enhances cognitive flexibility
- **Unconscious Computation**: Background processing continues during attention withdrawal
- **Context-Dependent Retrieval**: Solution accessibility depends on environmental affordances
- **Temporal Dynamics**: Incubation effects emerge over extended time periods (hours to weeks)
- **Individual Differences**: Incubation effectiveness varies across people and problem types
