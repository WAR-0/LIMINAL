### Core Theoretical Framework
- **Predictive Coding**: Brain actively predicts upcoming sensory input rather than passively registering it
- **Efficient Coding**: Brain evolved to code sensory information efficiently using strategies optimized to environmental statistics
- **Hierarchical Processing**: Predictions generated at higher levels "explain away" lower level representations

### Key Mechanisms

#### Explaining Away Process
- **Prediction Suppression**: Predictability reduces activity in early sensory areas through feedback from higher levels
- **Error Signal Representation**: Activity in lower areas represents only input not successfully predicted by higher areas
- **Feedback Modulation**: Higher level predictions actively suppress predictable lower-level representations

#### Neural Evidence

**Primary Visual Cortex (V1) Studies**:
- **Alink et al. (2010)**: Lower BOLD signal for predictable vs unpredictable stimuli
- **Apparent Motion Paradigm**: Used illusory motion to test predictability effects
- **Retinotopic Specificity**: Effects observed in V1 regions corresponding to stimulus location
- **Feedback Origin**: Effects likely reflect feedback from higher areas with larger receptive fields

**Cross-Modal Predictive Effects**:
- **den Ouden et al. (2010)**: Auditory cues predicting visual stimuli
- **FFA/PPA Suppression**: Reduced activation when faces/houses were predicted by tones
- **Short-term Learning**: Brain sensitive to arbitrary contingencies developed within experiment
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Participants adapted to changing probability rates without explicit instruction

### Prediction Error Processing

#### Putamen as Error Detector
- **Generic Error Signal**: Putamen signals prediction errors for multiple stimulus types
- **Gating Function**: Error detection gates connection between perceptual and motor areas
- **Adaptive Response**: Ensures stronger perceptual influence when predictions fail

#### Behavioral Correlates
- **Detection Paradox**: Higher detectability for predictable stimuli despite lower neural response
- **Attention Independence**: Effects not explained by attention allocation differences
- **Perceptual Enhancement**: Predictability improves rather than impairs perception

### Computational Implications
- **Hierarchical Architecture**: Multi-level prediction system with top-down feedback
- **Dynamic Learning**: Rapid adaptation to statistical regularities in environment
- **Resource Efficiency**: Eliminates redundant information processing across hierarchy levels
- **Error-Driven Updates**: Prediction errors guide learning and model refinement
- **Flexible Contingencies**: System adapts to both long-term and short-term statistical patterns
- **Cross-Modal Integration**: Predictive mechanisms operate across sensory modalities
