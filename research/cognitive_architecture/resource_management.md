## Cognitive Load & Resource Allocation Research Findings

### Baddeley's 4-Component Working Memory Model
- **Central Executive**: Master component that coordinates and integrates operations
- **Phonological Loop**: Stores speech-based information for language processing
- **Visuospatial Sketchpad**: Stores visuospatial information and non-linguistic data
- **Episodic Buffer**: Integrates episodes/chunks and links working memory with perception and long-term memory

### Resource Allocation Mechanism
- **Central Executive Function**: Allocates limited memory resources to slave components based on demand
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Resources shift based on task requirements (e.g., more to visuospatial if spatial processing becomes demanding)
- **Flexible Resource Model**: Memory demands change adaptively depending on circumstances and other task demands

### Overlap Hypothesis for Dual-Task Interference

#### Core Mechanism
- **Task-Specific Populations**: Each task recruits specific neuron populations in prefrontal cortex
- **Shared Neural Groups**: Some neurons participate in multiple tasks
- **Competition Process**: In dual-task conditions, tasks compete for shared neural resources
- **Functional Distance**: Interference strength depends on "functional brain distance" between task-related regions

#### Neural Evidence
**Imaging Studies**:
- **PET Studies**: Dual-tasks activate overlapping areas in prefrontal, parietal, and cingulate cortex
- **fMRI Findings**: Dual-task activation less than sum of individual task activations
- **Correlation**: Degree of brain area overlap correlates with performance decline

**Neurophysiological Studies**:
- **Prefrontal Recordings**: Neurons' ability to represent task information decreases proportionally with counterpart task demand
- **Overloaded Recruitment**: Dual-task interference caused by simultaneous overloaded recruitment of common neural populations

### Computational Principles
- **Neural Population Model**: Memory resources correspond to populations of task-related neurons
- **Competition Dynamics**: Tasks compete to recruit maximum neurons from shared pools
- **Winner-Loser Outcomes**: Competition results in normal performance for one task, impaired for other, or both impaired
- **Adaptive Allocation**: System flexibly allocates available resources based on current demands
- **Limited Capacity**: Shared neuron group size constrains overall system capacity


## Metacognition & Monitoring Research Findings

**Source: Fleming & Dolan, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 2012**

### Theoretical Framework
- **Two-Level Model**: Object level (cognition/task performance) and Meta level (monitoring and controlling object level)
- **Metacognitive Accuracy**: Degree to which individuals are aware of their success or failure
- **Dissociation**: Metacognitive accuracy is separable from task performance and varies across individuals

### Neural Substrates

#### Prefrontal Cortex Specialization
- **Rostral/Dorsal Lateral PFC**: Critical for accuracy of retrospective judgments of performance
- **Medial PFC**: Important for prospective judgments of performance
- **Hierarchical Processing**: PFC processes information from lower-level regions (primary sensory areas)

#### Proposed Neural Synthesis
- **Dorsolateral PFC**: Integrates with anterior prefrontal cortical subregions
- **Interoceptive Cortices**: Cingulate and insula contribute to accurate performance judgments
- **Network Integration**: Multiple regions work in concert for metacognitive monitoring

### Measurement Approaches

#### Types of Metacognitive Reports
- **Retrospective Confidence**: Judgments about past performance
- **Prospective Judgments**: Predictions about future performance
- **Feeling-of-Knowing**: Assessments of knowledge availability
- **Metamemory**: Monitoring of memory processes

#### Behavioral Dissociations
- **Performance Independence**: Metacognitive accuracy can be poor despite good task performance
- **Individual Differences**: Substantial variation in metacognitive ability across people
- **Domain Specificity**: Metacognitive accuracy may vary across different cognitive domains

### Clinical and Neuropsychological Evidence
- **Frontal Lobe Damage**: Deficits in self-knowledge of altered cognition and personality
- **Autonoetic Metacognition**: Impaired self-related awareness following brain injury
- **Confabulation**: Inaccurate self-reports and explanations for behavior

### Computational Principles
- **Hierarchical Monitoring**: Higher-level regions monitor lower-level processing
- **Signal Detection**: Metacognitive judgments based on internal signal strength
- **Confidence Calibration**: Alignment between subjective confidence and objective accuracy
- **Executive Control Integration**: Metacognition linked to cognitive control mechanisms
- **Introspective Accuracy**: Variable ability to access and report internal mental states

### Implications for Cognitive Architecture
- **Self-Knowledge Systems**: Dedicated neural mechanisms for monitoring cognitive processes
- **Adaptive Function**: Metacognition enables flexible control and learning
- **Network Organization**: Distributed system involving prefrontal, cingulate, and insular regions
- **Individual Variation**: Metacognitive ability as measurable cognitive capacity
- **Clinical Relevance**: Metacognitive deficits in various neurological and psychiatric conditions
