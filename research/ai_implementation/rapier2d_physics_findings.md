# Rapier2D Physics Research Findings

## Phase 1: Rapier2D Force Application

### Forces vs Impulses - Key Differences

**Source:** Official Rapier Documentation - https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/bevy_plugin/rigid_body_forces_and_impulses/

#### Fundamental Differences:

1. **Forces affect acceleration, Impulses affect velocity directly**
   - **Forces:** acceleration change = force / mass (Δa = m⁻¹f)
   - **Impulses:** velocity change = impulse / mass (Δv = m⁻¹i)

2. **Persistence:**
   - **Forces:** Persistent across simulation steps, need to be cleared manually
   - **Impulses:** Applied once, immediate effect

3. **Use Cases:**
   - **Forces:** Continuous effects like gravity, wind, thrust
   - **Impulses:** Instantaneous effects like jumps, collisions, explosions

#### Implementation in Rapier2D:

```rust
// Adding forces and impulses during entity creation
commands
    .spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic)
    .insert(ExternalForce {
        force: Vec2::new(1000.0, 2000.0),
        torque: 140.0,
    })
    .insert(ExternalImpulse {
        impulse: Vec2::new(100.0, 200.0),
        torque_impulse: 14.0,
    });

// Applying forces and impulses in systems
fn apply_forces(
    mut ext_forces: Query<&mut ExternalForce>,
    mut ext_impulses: Query<&mut ExternalImpulse>,
) {
    // Apply forces (persistent)
    for mut ext_force in ext_forces.iter_mut() {
        ext_force.force = Vec2::new(1000.0, 2000.0);
        ext_force.torque = 0.4;
    }
    
    // Apply impulses (one-time)
    for mut ext_impulse in ext_impulses.iter_mut() {
        ext_impulse.impulse = Vec2::new(100.0, 200.0);
        ext_impulse.torque_impulse = 0.4;
    }
}
```

#### Common Issues and Troubleshooting:

**If forces/impulses don't appear to work, check:**

1. **The rigid-body is dynamic** - Static and kinematic bodies won't respond
2. **Force magnitude is sufficient** - Try very large values to test
3. **Non-zero mass/inertia** - Bodies need mass to be affected by forces
   - Mass can be set explicitly or computed from colliders with non-zero densities
   - Zero mass = no response to linear forces
   - Zero angular inertia = no response to torques




### Comprehensive Troubleshooting Guide

**Source:** Rapier Common Mistakes - https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/rust/common_mistakes/

#### When Forces/Impulses Don't Work - Checklist:

1. **Rigid-body Type**
   - Must be a dynamic rigid-body
   - Static and kinematic bodies won't respond to forces

2. **Mass and Inertia**
   - Rigid-body must have non-zero mass (for linear forces)
   - Rigid-body must have non-zero angular inertia (for torques)
   - If no collider attached: mass will be zero unless set explicitly
   - If colliders attached: at least one collider must have non-zero density

3. **Force Magnitude**
   - Force/impulse must be strong enough to move the body
   - Test with very high values (e.g., magnitude of 100,000.0)
   - Common mistake: using pixel units instead of meters

4. **Body State**
   - Rigid-body must be **awake**
   - Call `RigidBody::wake_up(true)` explicitly
   - Or use `true` as last argument in force/impulse application method

5. **Special Cases**
   - Triangle-mesh colliders don't compute mass automatically
   - Must set mass/angular inertia manually for triangle-mesh-only bodies

#### Common Panic Issues:

**Panic Message:** `"assertion failed: proxy.aabb.maxs[dim] >= self.min_bound"`
- **Cause:** NaN values in collider positions
- **Most Common Trigger:** Two dynamic rigid-bodies with zero mass in contact
- **Solution:** Ensure all dynamic rigid-bodies have non-zero mass

#### Scale and Units Issues:

**Problem:** Simulation appears to run in slow-motion
- **Cause:** Using pixels as physics units (e.g., 100x100 pixel sprite = 100x100 meter collider)
- **Solution:** Use SI units (meters, seconds, kilograms)
- **Recommended:** 1 physics meter = 50 pixels scaling factor
- **Implementation:**
  ```rust
  // Scale translation from meters to pixels
  sprite.set_translation(rigid_body.translation() * 50.0);
  // Rotation doesn't need scaling
  sprite.set_rotation(rigid_body.rotation().angle());
  ```

#### Performance Considerations:

**Build Configuration:**
- Always use release mode: `cargo build --release`
- Rapier can be 100x slower without optimizations
- For dev builds, optimize Rapier specifically:
  ```toml
  [profile.dev.package.rapier3d]
  opt-level = 3
  ```
- Further optimization:
  ```toml
  [profile.release]
  codegen-units = 1
  ```



## Phase 2: Physics Simulation Debugging for Tentacle Chains

### Tentacle Structure Implementation Issues

**Source:** Game Development Stack Exchange - https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/50723/creating-stable-tentacle-structures

#### Common Problems with Verlet Integration Tentacles:

**Problem:** Tentacle "flip-over" when forces are too big at the peak
- **Symptoms:** Tentacle gets stuck in ugly inverted state
- **Cause:** Insufficient constraint satisfaction iterations vs. performance requirements

#### Proposed Solutions:

1. **Skeletal Approach (Recommended)**
   - Use single linear chain as "skeleton" instead of solid object
   - Procedurally wrap descending trapezoids around skeleton
   - Build body using quadrilaterals from crossbars
   - **Advantages:** 
     - Realistic motion without structural consistency issues
     - Easier contact simulation via backsolving forces to skeleton
     - Better performance

2. **Constraint Tuning**
   - Tighter curvature constraints near base, looser at tip
   - Accounts for thickness variation along tentacle
   - Mimics natural tentacle behavior

3. **Force Distribution (Muscle-like System)**
   - **Problem with current approach:** All force starts at base, propagates outward (creates whip behavior)
   - **Natural solution:** Each segment affected by small number of local forces
   - **Implementation:** 
     - Small forces between nodes (mimic muscles)
     - "Brain" system to animate forces over time
     - Local force propagation instead of global

#### Alternative Fixes for Flip-Over Issue:

1. **Add more points at the peak** - Increases stability but affects performance
2. **More constraints overall** - Better stability, performance cost
3. **Limit possible forces** - Prevents extreme cases but may feel artificial
4. **Detect flip-over and undo** - Reactive solution, may cause visual artifacts
5. **Complete redesign** - Consider skeletal approach above

#### Key Insight: Physics vs. Biological Accuracy
- **Real tentacles:** Work via internal muscles, local force distribution
- **Common mistake:** Global force propagation from base
- **Result:** Whip-like behavior instead of natural tentacle movement


### Physics Simulation Methods Comparison

**Source:** The quest for perfect collisions - https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/posts/perfect-collisions.html

#### Overview of Physics Simulation Approaches:

**Common Problem:** Angular momentum not conserved, leading to accelerated spinning and system instability

#### 1. Force-Based Collisions

**Method:** Apply spring-like forces proportional to penetration distance
```cpp
if (distance < sum_radii) {
    vec2 force = K * (sum_radii - distance) * (delta / distance);
    particles[i].velocity -= K * dt / particles[i].mass;
    particles[j].velocity += K * dt / particles[j].mass;
}
```

**Problems:**
- Takes time to separate particles, allowing continued penetration
- Can lead to enormous accelerations due to collision force being too strong
- Gravitational force can overcome collision force
- Performance vs. stability trade-off

**Results:** Works initially but becomes chaotic, particles can "yeet" away

#### 2. Impulse-Based Collisions

**Method:** Instantaneous velocity changes based on collision constraints
- **Key Insight:** Impulses are proportional to velocities (first-order derivatives)
- **Advantage:** Simpler to work with due to discrete nature of simulation

**Core Concept:**
- Constraint equation: f(x₁, x₂) ≥ 0 (separation between particles)
- Apply impulse to satisfy constraint instantly
- Uses momentum conservation principles

**Implementation:**
```cpp
vec2 collision_normal = delta / distance;
vec2 relative_speed = particles[j].velocity - particles[i].velocity;
float constraint_speed = dot(collision_normal, relative_speed);
if (distance < sum_radii && constraint_speed < 0.f) {
    float reduced_mass = 1.f / (1.f / particles[i].mass + 1.f / particles[j].mass);
    vec2 impulse = -collision_normal * constraint_speed * reduced_mass;
    particles[i].velocity -= impulse / particles[i].mass;
    particles[j].velocity += impulse / particles[j].mass;
}
```

**Problems:**
1. **Constraint drifting:** Resolves relative velocity but doesn't prevent penetration
2. **Sticking behavior:** Particles stick together instead of bouncing

**Solution - Baumgarte Stabilization:**
- Instead of solving f(x) = 0, solve d/dt f(x) = -β/Δt f(x)
- Parameter β (0 ≤ β ≤ 1) controls constraint violation tolerance
- β = 0.125 often works well

#### 3. Position-Based Collisions

**Method:** Directly move particles apart to resolve penetration
- **Concept:** Zero-th derivative approach - work directly with positions
- **Advantage:** Extremely simple to implement and understand

**Implementation:**
```cpp
if (constraint_value < 0.f && constraint_speed < 0.f) {
    vec2 offset = constraint_value * collision_normal;
    float total_mass = particles[i].mass + particles[j].mass;
    particles[i].position += offset * particles[j].mass / total_mass;
    particles[j].position -= offset * particles[i].mass / total_mass;
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Move particles proportional to other particle's mass
- Large particle colliding with small one: small particle moves more
- Intuitive mass-based displacement

**Results:** More stable than force-based, simpler than impulse-based

#### 4. Position-Based with Verlet Integration

**Combination:** Position-based collision resolution + Verlet integration
- **Advantage:** Verlet naturally handles position-based modifications
- **Stability:** Better energy conservation than Euler methods
- **Performance:** Good balance of stability and computational efficiency

#### Method Comparison Summary:

| Method | Stability | Performance | Implementation | Energy Conservation |
|--------|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Force-based | Poor | Good | Medium | Poor |
| Impulse-based | Good | Medium | Complex | Good |
| Position-based | Good | Good | Simple | Medium |
| Position+Verlet | Very Good | Good | Simple | Good |

#### Recommendations for Chain/Tentacle Physics:

1. **For Rapier2D:** Use impulse-based approach with Baumgarte stabilization
2. **For Custom Implementation:** Position-based with Verlet integration
3. **For Stability:** Avoid force-based methods for connected body systems
4. **For Performance:** Position-based methods offer best simplicity/performance ratio


## Phase 3: Alternative Implementation Approaches

### PIXI.js Simple Rope Implementation (Without Physics Engine)

**Source:** Stack Overflow - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27450147/is-there-a-better-way-to-accomplish-this-pixi-rope-mouse-follower

#### Simple Mouse-Following Rope Approach:

**Core Concept:** Create evenly spaced points based on mouse movement and render textured PIXI.Rope

**Key Implementation Details:**
```javascript
// Basic rope creation
var tRope = PIXI.Texture.fromImage("rope_texture.png");
var points = []; // Array of PIXI.Point objects
var rope = new PIXI.Rope(tRope, points);

// Point management with distance thresholds
var threshold_lower = 10;  // Minimum distance before adding point
var threshold_upper = 15;  // Maximum distance for single point
var lineLength = 1000;     // Total rope length limit

// Mouse movement handler
document.body.addEventListener('mousemove', function(e) {
    var pos = new PIXI.Point(e.clientX, e.clientY);
    var v = pos.clone().sub(points[points.length - 1]);
    var l = v.length();
    
    if(l > threshold_lower) {
        if(l <= threshold_upper) {
            addPoint(pos);
        } else {
            // Add multiple points for large distances
            var divisions = Math.floor(l / threshold_upper);
            var divisionlength = l / divisions;
            // ... add intermediate points
        }
    }
    
    // Remove old points to maintain rope length
    if(totalLength > lineLength) {
        // Remove points from beginning
    }
});
```

**Problems with Basic Approach:**
- Rendering artifacts when moving quickly
- Glitches when rope overlaps itself
- Performance issues with complex rope textures

**Improved Solution (from answers):**
```javascript
// Physically remove and recreate rope each frame
animate = function() {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    stage.removeChild(rope);
    rope = new PIXI.Rope(tRope, points);
    stage.addChild(rope, 0);
    renderer.render(stage);
}
```

**Advantages:**
- Very simple implementation
- No complex physics calculations
- Direct control over rope behavior
- Good performance for simple cases

**Disadvantages:**
- No realistic physics behavior
- Limited to simple following patterns
- Requires manual constraint management
