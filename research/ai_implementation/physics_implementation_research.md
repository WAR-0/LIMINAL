## 3. Critical Production Issues in Modern Physics Engines

### 3.1 Unity ECS Physics - Production Readiness Problems

#### Friction System Bug Analysis:
**Source**: Giannis Akritidis, August 4, 2025

#### Root Cause: Incorrect Combination Rule Ordering
- **Problem**: ECS Physics applies wrong material's combination rule
- **Expected Behavior**: Follow PhysX and GameObject physics conventions
- **Actual Behavior**: Uses incorrect material precedence for friction calculation

#### Specific Bug Examples:

**Example 1: Average vs Minimum Conflict**
- **Material A**: Friction = 0.5, Combination = Average
- **Material B**: Friction = 0.1, Combination = Minimum
- **Current (Incorrect) Result**: 0.3 (using Average rule)
- **Expected (Correct) Result**: 0.1 (using Minimum rule)
- **Impact**: Objects slow down differently than designed

**Example 2: Critical Frictionless Behavior**
- **Material A**: Friction = 0 (frictionless), Combination = Minimum
- **Material B**: Friction = 0.8, Combination = Average
- **Current (Incorrect) Result**: Objects eventually stop moving
- **Expected (Correct) Result**: Objects never stop (friction = 0)
- **Impact**: Complete gameplay behavior change

#### Newton's Third Law Violations:
- **Physics Principle**: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction"
- **Implementation Requirement**: Forces between interacting bodies must be equal and opposite
- **Current Issue**: Inconsistent friction calculations violate this fundamental law
- **Consequence**: Unrealistic physics behavior in production games

#### Breaking Change Implications:
- **Existing Projects**: Bug fix will break current implementations

- **GameObject Physics**: Uses multiplication (friction = a × b)
- **ECS Physics**: Uses geometric mean (friction = √(a × b))
- **Unity Warning**: "Multiplication mode not directly convertible between systems"
- **Impact**: Noticeably different friction behavior between systems

#### Conversion Challenges:
- **No Direct Mapping**: Cannot automatically convert between systems
